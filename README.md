# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

# Overview
The purpose of this project is to use R to analyze MechaCar data to identify key metrics and trends that will help the manufacturing team make decisions about the production process. The data set contains information about the MechaCar prototypes, including vehicle length, weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance. The data set also contains information about the miles per gallon (MPG) of each prototype. The MechaCar team is interested in understanding how the different variables affect the MPG of the MechaCar prototypes.
